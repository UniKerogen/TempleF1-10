### Instruction for Installing Ubuntu on Laptops 

In this specific instruction, we will tri-boot a Macbook Pro. 
We will first install Windows 10 in Macbook running macOS 10.12.5 and then install ubuntu on Windows 10.

**IF** you are running Windows 10 already, skip to _Setting up Ubuntu on Windows_

#### Setting up Windows on Mac
**Before** you try any of this, make sure your laptop is backed up.

1. Make sure that you have sufficient storage space for your Mac.
2. Back up MacBook via Time Machine or else.
3. Download Windows 10 iso file from Microsoft’s official website. The iso file should be about 5 GB. As for March 2017, the version they offer is 1709. [Here is the Link](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO)
4. After download the iso file, make sure MacBook has sufficient storage to install Windows. Go to the apple logo on the top left corner of the screen, click and go to “About this Mac” > “Storage”. You will need at least 70GB free space to make sure all three system will function properly without storage problems.
<br />- Generally, Windows 10 takes about 30 GB for system file, so we recommend 50GB for Windows 10; Ubuntu takes about 5GB for system file, so we recommend 10 GB for ubuntu. The installation takes about 8GB of your system storage, which will not be accessible for either of the system. [Please CHECK the further requirement here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201468)


5. Open Boot Camp Assistant. It can be found under Dashboard > Utilities or search it from Spotlight Search or ask Siri to find it for you.
